# Webfuse Labs

> [**Webfuse**](https://webfuse.com) is a web augmentation platform to instantly extend, automate & share any web session. Webfuse extensions are browser extensions, but enhanced with a powerful augmentation API.

**Webfuse Labs** is a framework that facilitates extension development: Build with a bundler made for extensions, in a local preview environment. It supports Typescript and SCSS out-of-the-box, and also [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html)-inspired single file components. Imagine [Vite](https://vite.dev), but for extensions.
